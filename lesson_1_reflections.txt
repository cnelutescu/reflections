How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Helped a lot.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
See what was changed in the long term from the negining.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Git = + Each commit should have one clear, logical purpose and + you should never do too much work without committing.
Google docs = - Each commit is not a clear logical purpose and + you should never do too much work without committing

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git - The files are logicaly connected, work together; Docs - viceversa

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can revert to any previous version and run it.
